	abstract = {Hebbian models of development and learning require both activity-dependent
	synaptic plasticity and a mechanism that induces competition between
	different synapses. One form of experimentally observed long-term
	synaptic plasticity, which we call spike-timing-dependent plasticity
	(STDP), depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action
	potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this form of synaptic
	modification can automatically balance synaptic strengths to make
	postsynaptic firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic spike
	timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a
	balanced regime. Synapses modifiable by STDP compete for control
	of the timing of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire
	the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that act in correlated
	groups are able to compete most successfully and develop strong synapses,
	while synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs are weakened.},
